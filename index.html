                   <p id="mainParagraph"> Cars came into global use during the 20th century, and developed economies
        depend on them. The year 1886 is regarded as the birth year of the modern car when German inventor Karl Benz
        patented his Benz Patent-Motorwagen. Cars became widely available in the early 20th century. One of the first
        cars accessible to the masses was the 1908 Model T, an American car manufactured by the Ford Motor Company. Cars
        were rapidly adopted in the US, where they replaced animal-drawn carriages and carts, but took much longer to be
        accepted in Western Europe and other parts of the world. </p>

            Cars have controls for driving, parking, passenger comfort, and a variety of lights. </p>

            Over the decades, additional features and controls have been added to vehicles, making them progressively
            more complex, but also more reliable and easier to operate.
